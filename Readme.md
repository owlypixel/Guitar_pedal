## What is this?
Have you ever seen a guitar pedal done in pure CSS? Now you have! This project's main challenge was to try to recreate a look of a simpe guitar pedal as close to original as possible. Well, you can see for yourself what the final version looks like. Of course being a huge owl enthusiast, I couldn't miss the chance to stuff an owly logo on it. Enjoy!
You can play around and experiment with it [here](https://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/BQKZzq) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### JS
- Some simple JQuery code to toggle class of the element (turning led of the pedal on and off)

### CSS
- SASS mixin for centering absolutely positioned elements
- Applying CSS animations to rotate knobs
- Creating cool metal-looking button in CSS
- Using pseudo elements 
- Creating cool linear gradient for the body
- Other things you didn't know before
